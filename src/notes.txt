Note: 

for the Catalog project, we use the vertical Slice method/architecture

We added all library required on the catalog, basket and ordering microservice project to this Building block. That way, we do not have to install the packages on all the various project

Carter to handle the Request
Mapster to handle the mapping from request to command object (using the mapster mapping library), to convert our request to the mediatr command object

Carter will manage the API endpoints and mediatR will handle the business logic through our commands and handlers

We create a Globalusing class to avoid repeating the same using objects in our classes . Example: "using MediatR"

Due to some limitations, we remove dthe carter from the building block project and installed on the CatalogAPI project directly

Catalog Servuce use Marten for PostgreSQL interaction as a Document DB
